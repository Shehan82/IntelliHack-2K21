I was able to use my ideas and knowledge and was inspired to learn more about machine learning. This is a must have experience if you are interested in AI and ML. The OC went above and beyond to make the event a success, and the participants were comfortable during this overnight hackathon. Everything was perfect. Kudos to the OC of intellihack and the IEEE Computer Society Student Branch Chapter of UCSC for their efforts and hardwork!”",
